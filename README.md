# 3dVoxelgame
 Please use Python 2.7 so it works!\
 I made a minecraft like game using only Python and Ursina and its good!\
 Keep in mind the world isn't 60M by 60M like original. I think it is like 64 by 64 blocks wide world.\
 The looking around is jittery so please help me fix it!\
 (I even used ChatGPT to try to help me with the looking system!)\
 WASD = Movement\
 [spacebar] = Jump\
 Mouse = Break/Place blocks and looking around.
