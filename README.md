 Please use Python 2.7 so it works!\
 I made a game using only Python and Ursina and its good!\
 The looking around is jittery so please help me fix it!\
 (I even used ChatGPT to try to help me with the looking system!)\
 WASD = Movement\
 [spacebar] = Jump\
 Mouse = Break/Place blocks and looking around.
